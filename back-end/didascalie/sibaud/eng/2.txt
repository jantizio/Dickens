A view of Chiostro Terzo, towards the north from the portico of the Cappella dei Suffragi. The engraving was part of Marcellino Sibaud’s ambitious editorial project that was never completed: Il cimitero comunale di Bologna: opera archeologico-storico descrittiva (1837).  Marcellino Sibaud gives us a vision of the Certosa as a “non cemetery”, a pleasant place to go for a walk. The view is proportionate but the people are very small: this technique aimed to give the idea of grandeur.

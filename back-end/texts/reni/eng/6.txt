Samson or Victorious Samson, one of the most famous paintings by Guido Reni, was commissioned by Count Luigi Zambeccari as decoration for a fireplace in his home on Via Riva di Reno in Bologna. The work was later purchased by Cardinal Girolamo Boncompagni to prevent it from being sold abroad. It was donated to the City Senate in 1684.
Samson, the valiant fighter from the Old Testament, is depicted on the battlefield while drinking from a donkey's jawbone with which he has just killed a thousand Philistines, exemplified in the corpses on the ground, on many levels.

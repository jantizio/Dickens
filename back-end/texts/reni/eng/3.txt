Despite the turbulent nature of the subject, the painting’s layout follows a precise compositional scheme with the two opposing symmetrical groups of figures at the sides and, isolated, right in the centre of the scene, the dagger of one of the executioners, symbol of the entire subject.
The action seems to be frozen in the culminating moment, suspended in the moment between the before and after of the bloody event, as stated by writer and art critic Cesare Garboli, “exactly in the point where nothing happens”. The violence remains confined to the bruised corpses of the children in the foreground and the chilling screams of the women.

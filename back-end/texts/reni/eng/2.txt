The painting, commissioned for the chapel of the Berò family in the Bolognese church of San Domenico and painted in 1611 probably during the artist’s sojourn in Rome, depicts the episode of the massacre of the innocents, narrated in the Gospel according to Matthew.
Between two ancient architectural backdrops, reminiscent of a theatrical stage set, two women on the right seek refuge with their children. A man, portrayed from behind, chases a screaming woman, and another, with dagger in hand, bends over the mothers who, kneeling on the ground, scramble to protect the children or cry over the bodies of those already slain.
High in the sky, two little angels display the palms of martyrdom.

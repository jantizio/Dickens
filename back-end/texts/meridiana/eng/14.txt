Of course, the Italic time, at the local noon, will increase as we go from the summer solstice (day with the most hours of sunlight - "in summer the days get longer"-) towards the winter solstice (day with the least number of hours of sunlight - "in winter it is dark early"-), to then resume to increase again , as the sun makes the reverse path, approaching spring and summer.

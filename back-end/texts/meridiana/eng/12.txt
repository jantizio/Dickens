Zanotti considered completely renewing the instrument, while keeping unchanged the fundamental dimensions established by Cassini. Using the same tools created by Cassini, the gnomonic forum was placed at a perfect height, also bringing it to the vertical start of the line. The line ends almost against the internal facade of the church, with the incision of the solar projection of the winter solstice of 1655 traced by Cassini. The meridian was inaugurated on October 4th 1776, followed by a book that illustrated its characteristics. Since this date, it has not undergone any further transformation. 
Zanotti carried out a new revision in 1778 and one on January 7th 1780, particularly necessary following various earthquakes including the one that happened on June 10th 1779. 
In 1904 a check was carried out by Federico Guarducci and another in April 1925. With triangulations, it was observed whether the central elements remained unchanged, that is, the height of the gnomon’s centre, its projection on the floor of the church and the orientation of the meridian line.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>
The check in 1904 was carried out following his appointment as honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. Having to draw up a memoir for this occasion to be presented to the academy, Professor Guarducci chose the state of conservation of the sundial as the subject of study. For his research, he made use of the techniques of Geodesy, making appropriate triangulations with the theodolite. The memoir was read in the session in May 28th 1905 and was titled ‘The sundial of the temple of S. Petronio in 1904’. In his report, Guarducci reported that:
The gnomonic height turned out to be 27,0699m and therefore still corresponded to the original one. 
the centre of the hole had not undergone significant displacements with repsect to the vertical point.
The meridian line was slightly deviating by 1’ 36,6” to the east, with a constant delay in the indication of noon 2.5 seconds at the summer solstice and 6.5 seconds at the winter solstice. 
The most significant drops in the meridian line, assuming the vertical point as the base altitude, were found on the equinoctial plate (-8 millimetres) and on that of the winter solstice 9-7 millimetres)
These, and many other measures led to the conclusion that the general state of the sundial had remained almost unchanged since its complete makeover that was carried out in 1776 Eustachio Zanotti, which were necessary due to its deterioration 80 years after the restoration carried out by Cassini himself and assisted by  Domenico Guglielmini.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>
The most recent structural checks on this formidable and highly accurate scientific instrument, with which Cassini restored the astronomy of the time from its foundations, were in 2005 on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of its construction. 
The year 2005 is known as the Cassinian year, and is dedicated to Giovanni Domenico Cassini. The celebrations to honour his memory included the 350th anniversary of the constructionof his San Petronio sundial, the 30th anniversary of the construction of the Loiano Observatory that bears his name, and the mission of the Cassini probe in orbit around Saturn, named after him because of the important role he played in the study of the division of the rings of that planet.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> 
The most relevant observation that emerged during the structural check on the sundial in 2005 is a notable failure of the entire sundial towards the north due to subsidence. Taking the vertical point as reference altitude, it was found that the winter solstice plate was almost 42mm low,compared to the 7mm found by Guarducci.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>

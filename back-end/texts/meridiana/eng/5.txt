Every day, the sun from that hole projects its image on the ground, which over the minutes gets closer and closer to the line: when it intersects it, it is the true local noon, the moment in which the star is halfway between the sunrise and sunset of that place. 
Meridian lines in Italy exist in large numbers and of all sizes. The longest, however, is the one drawn inside the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna, with a hole located 27 metres above the ground, and with a 67m long line: the longest in the world, built in 1655 by  the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Meridian lines, and in particular the Petronian one, contributed to the development of astronomy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

Cassini, instead of placing the hole on the back wall as Danti had done, decided to make it at the top of one of the vaults on the left aisle. The line would have occupied a large part of the nave, ending its last stretch in the central one. To do this, a point had to be chosen where the columns of the church did not prevent the development of the line on the ground, which had to have an obligatory North-South route. 
The columns in fact had led Danti to a plotting error, preventing him from obtaining precise results. It would have passed by touching the first and second columns, remaining entirely horizontal from one solstice to the next, its width would have been about two and a half times the gnomonic height. 
Having defined the exact position of the hole on the vault, at that point, a block of marble was cemented with an abundant opening in the centre, and on that horizontal plane, a thin brass plate was fixed in the centre of which the real hole was made. Its diameter was one thousandth part of the gnomonic height.

The Basilica of San Petronio
The Basilica of San Petronio, dedicated to the city’s patron saint (eighth bishop of Bologna from 431 to 450), is the largest and most important church in Bologna (132m long, 66m high, 47m high). It was the last late great Gothic work in Italy, begun shortly after the Milan Cathedral, in 1930, under the direction of Antonio di Vincenzo. The construction dates back to June 7th 1390 with the laying of the first stone in a solemn procession. In 1388, the Council of the seventeenth century of the municipality of Bologna decided to begin the construction of a temple dedicated to Bishop Petronio who later became the patron saint of the city. It was to be the largest church in the world. In 1514,  Arduino deli Arriguzzi proposed a new latin model that would have surpassed the size of the San Pietro church in Rome. 
According to the legend, Pius IV blocked the construction of the basilica, demanding the works for the construction of the Archiginnasio. The façade also remained unfinished. In 1656 the current apse was built, to close the aisles, obviously without continuing the work of the transepts, which are still visibly only sketched and unfinished. In 1658 the glassmakers bill for the large windows of the choir and in 1659 the bill for the stairway of the main altar were paid. In 1662 the ciborium was raised above the main altar and finished in 1663. The construction works were completed on this date.

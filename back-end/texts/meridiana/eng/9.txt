 
For the exceptional qualities of being able to verify the dimensions of the apparent diameter of the sun, Cassini called the instrument a heliometer. With it, it was possible to determine every day, the height of the sun at noon. With the sundial, you only get the instant in which the sun is 'in meridie', that is, it crosses the long meridian, or the time of the true local noon. It is like a horizontal sun clock, where the gnomon is a very high hole from which the sun's rays generate a luminous cone that, projecting itself onto the ground, acts as a  'dark room'. 
When the sunlight enters through the opening, you can see its image projected on the floor; as the minutes pass, it gets closer and closer to the meridian line. When it is centred, at 12 o'clock, it coincides with the maximum height of the sun above the horizon. The sundial has two functions. First of all, it always indicated the south. Secondly, it has a goniometric function, the sun's rays take on a different angle at noon every day. Through a trigonometric calculation, the projected centre of the solar image can be determined for a given day. Conversely, from a point defined on the line, it is possible to determine the respective date. 
In two years, the new sundial was completed. From the vaults of S. Petronio, comes the ray of sunshine which, for centuries, has marked midday in Bologna.<sup><a href=""#7>7</a></sup>
The results obtained with the meridian made Cassini one of the most important astronomers of the century. So much so, that in 1669, Louis XIV invited him to Paris at the new Observatoire Royal.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
In 1695, he returned to Bologna with his son Jacques, and checked as well as restored the sundial, making some important changes. Cassini died in Paris in 1712, when he was 87. He was buried in Saint Jacques du Haut-pas church with a simple plaque reading “J.D. Cassini- astronomer”. His research is still relevant and in use today, not many have the honour of being mentioned in scientific literature after more than 300 years.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>

In his brief and fleeting visit to Bologna, Dickens emphasises the wealth of the clergy and the pretentiousness of the religious buildings “with more birds flying in and out of chinks in the stones; and more snarling monsters for the bases of the pillars. Again, rich churches, drowsy Masses, curling incense, tinkling bells, priests in bright vestments: pictures, tapers, laced altar cloths, crosses, images, and artificial flowers.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

In the second capital of the <a href="/pontificio">Papal state</a>, the assets of the Church included more than 60 convents and numerous buildings of worship; extravagant and imposing but desolate places inhabited by birds and with monotonous and sleepy religious rites. In Bologna, as well as in the other Italian towns and cities he visited, Dickens mentions the bad governance of the Papal State, the darkness of the churches and the monotonous liturgy of the religious rites.

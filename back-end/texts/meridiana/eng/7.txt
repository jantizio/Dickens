The Meridian of San Petronio
A first sundial was built in San Petronio by Ignazio Danti, a Dominican from Perugia, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, and astronomer. This line crossed the central nave and took light made from a hole in the extreme point of the wall that closed the left aisle. Danti's instrument was destroyed in 1653 during the extension of the church, making the sundial useless.  The great italian astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini took this opportunity to propose the construction of a new and greater solar instrument. 
In 1650, Gian Domenico Cassini was given the privilege of becoming head of astronomy at the University of Bologna. It was a great moment for Italian astronomy, and Cassini was just 25 years old at the time. 
During a period when astronomical science was important, there was a need to create new and modern instruments capable of providing more precise data. After the sundial built by Ignazio Danti became useless due to the expansion of the church, Cassini proposed and then commissioned, with the help of his friend  Marquis-Senator Malvasia, a sundial with much larger dimensions (a hole at a height of 27,010m, and meridian length of 67m).<sup><a href="6">6</a></sup>
Construction began in 1655, and it remains the longest meridian line in the world.

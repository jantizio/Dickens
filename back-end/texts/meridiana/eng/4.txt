The Meridian of San Petronio Basilica 
As explained by Giovanni Paltrinieri, a well-known expert in solar clocks and Meridian lines, if we define “Meridians” or sundials, they are often dials found painted on the external wall of a house which indicate the time using a shadow line (Gnomon). To be more precise, these are ‘solar clocks’ as they do their job for a considerable part of the day. 
True ‘Meridians’, on the other hand, are solar instruments capable of indicating only the true local noon, or the instant in which the sun crosses the Meridian of a given place. Usually of considerable size, they make use of a modest sized hole made in the ceiling or in the wall of a building, to which the layout of a North-South line corresponds to the ground.

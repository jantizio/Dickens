From 1697 to 1727, many observations and studies were made by various scientists on the sundial in San Petronio. Among these, Eustachio Manfredi and Andrea Celsius di Upsala, the inventor of the centesimal scale of thermometers.

 In 1722 Manfredi made some corrections to the sundial, and later in 1776, the great astronomer Eustachio Zanotti assisted by dott. Matteucci. The marble was changed, with wider strips which gave greater stability to the plane of the line. 

The iron ruler was replaced with a well polished brass one, bearing at the top a line engraved in the middle. 

The new line is made up of two trapezoidal section rods, placed side by side within a dovetail joint made in the marble. 

The Cassini division into degrees was replaced by a series of numbers in order to know the time of noon without resorting to the tables. The sunburst decoration with gliding around the gnomic opening in the vault was also revived.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>

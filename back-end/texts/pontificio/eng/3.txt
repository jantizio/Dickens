On June 19, 1796 Napoleon arrived in Bologna and declared the Papal government collapsed, returning Bologna to its ancient government. With the arrival of Napoleon, the city first became the capital of the Cispadana Republic and then the second centre, after Milan, of the Cisalpine Republic. The powers were provisionally concentrated in the Senate which, however, should have sworn allegiance to the Cisalpine Republic. With this political move, Napoleon earned the support of the Bolognese aristocracy and Bologna moved in the direction (opposite to the Roman one) of the social and cultural renewal of secular and bourgeois Europe. Napoleonic politics provided for a climate of expectations towards the new transformations of society, and for this reason the albero delle libert√† was built in Piazza Maggiore. Meanwhile a group of distinguished Bolognese jurists began to prepare a new constitution which was approved on 4 December 1796, the first democratic constitution of what will eventually become Italy. During the French occupation, several works of art made their way to France due to the Napoleonic spoliations. According to Canova's list, of the 31 works of art from Bologna sent to France in July 1796, only 16 returned to Italy after the Congress of Vienna.
In the subsequent years, following the measures that suppressed religious orders and the confiscation of their assets, many of the seventy convents in the city were transformed into offices, schools, barracks or sold to private individuals.

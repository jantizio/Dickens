For a long time the second most important city of the Papal State, Bologna's urban structures are kept following the arrival of the Napoleonic troops, with the creation of a cemetery outside the walls at the Carthusian convent, the reorganization of university buildings and institutions, cultural events in general, the opening of theaters, the Agricultural School and the Botanical Garden.
Among the most important transformations was that of the cemetery of Bologna in 1801 (the monumental cemetery of the Certosa di Bologna), previously the convent of the Carthusian monks. A new structure and new headquarters are given to cultural institutions in what will become the university district: the Studio moves from the Archiginnasio to Palazzo Poggi, the Academy of Fine Arts is housed in the former convent of Sant'Ignazio together with the National Art Gallery, while the Conservatory occupies the former convent of San Giacomo. Furthermore, the Teatro del Corso and the Contavalli theater were founded (which no longer remain today, the first due to war events, the second due to neglect), the Arena del Sole (built in the former convent of the Dominican nuns of S. Maria Maddalena), and the portico leading to the sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca was completed. In the same period the architect Giovan Battista Martinetti transformed the hill of rubble near Porta Galliera into Montagnola Park.

After Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Restoration returned Bologna to a reconstituted but weak Papal State, which required Austrian presence to protect its power. With the Papal Restoration, the city went through a period of economic crisis and the University was also heading towards a period of decline.
The Restoration of Papal authority brought back to the city a cloak of provincialism and poverty that can be found in the pages of many nineteenth-century visitors, the image of Bologna was still perceived as a gloomy medieval city, with buildings bearing the signs of time and superficies due to variations in use. A shaded pathway of arcades was developed along the irregular layout of its streets, arranged in a radial pattern around the Two Towers. A picturesque city because, even without having actual ruins, it is both ancient and decadent. Its population, not only that in the dilapidated suburbs little visited by tourists, also showed signs of widespread misery and begging: the quintessence of the picturesque that stands out against the surrounding urban background. Even Dickens in his book Pictures from Italy remains bound by this interpretation of the city: “an ancient sombre town, under the brilliant sky; with heavy arcades over the footways of the older streets, and lighter and more cheerful archways in the newer portions of the town.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

The control of the Papal State lasted uninterrupted for almost three centuries, from the expulsion of the Bentivoglio family in 1506, to the Napoleonic occupation that destroyed Europe and held power in Bologna in 1796.
Following the French Revolution which broke out in Paris in 1789, students Luigi Zamboni and Giovanni Battista De Rolandis, inspired by news from beyond the Alps on the overthrow of the ‘anciènt régime’ and by patriotic liberal ideals, in 1794 tried to organize an insurrection against the Papal State. With the probable help of French spy, Antoine Christophe Saliceti, they managed to obtain some rifles, had colored badges made (cockades, rosettes and shoulder bags) and prepared fifty posters to be distributed to Bolognese citizens. Betrayed by a spy, they were forced to change the day of the revolt to the night November 13th, simply distributing posters and rosettes. Because of a violent storm, the uprising failed and the two were forced to flee towards Tuscany. Arrested and tortured by the Inquisition, Zamboni was found dead in his cell on August 18, 1795, while De Rolandis was publicly executed on April 23, 1796.

The Restoration negatively influenced intellectual activity and only fuelled the conspiratorial actions of the sects, in particular that of the Carbonaro group of the Guelphs. They already supported the idea of a united Italy but it was only with the spontaneous Risorgimento uprisings in 1831 (which spread to all the Italian United Provinces of which Bologna was the capital) that they obtained a wide support of citizenship.
The revolutionary wind of 1848 also shakes Bologna which on 8 August rises against the Austrians, temporarily expelled north of the Po (the revolutionaries Ugo Bassi and Giovanni Livraghi will be shot by the Austrians in Bologna in 1849). Then finally in 1859 the annexation to Piedmont, the first step towards a united Italy, which was born in 1861.

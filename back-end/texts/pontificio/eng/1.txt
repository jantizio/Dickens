In 1844, when Dickens visited Bologna, Italy was divided into regional states: the Papal State was the one that ruled over Bologna.
The Papal State began to forge around the Byzantine era (seventh century), when, with the constitution of the Roman duchy, the figure of the Pope first came alongside, then replaced, the imperially appointed dux within the territory. The Donation of Sutri, the Promissio carisiaca (also known as the carisiaca donation) and the Roman Constitution were milestones in the creation of the Papal State. From a simple private land property of the Church, it became one of the most influential and prestigious political bodies in Europe. The international projection of this state in medieval times and in the first two centuries of the modern age went well beyond the narrow territorial limits that destiny had assigned to it. The Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Crown of Aragon, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Hungary were its vassals and kings and emperors sometimes had to prostrate themselves in the presence of their sovereign, the Pope. After over a thousand years of existence, the Papal State dissolved in 1870, following the annexation of its last strips of territory, Rome and Lazio, to the rising Kingdom of Italy.

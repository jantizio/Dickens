The monumental altarpiece with the Martyrdom of St. Agnes, commissioned by Pietro Martire Carli for the convent of Sant'Agnese in Bologna, was begun by Domenichino in 1619 and completed in Rome, where the artist had sojourned in 1621.
In this complex painting, the artist established himself as one of the most important representatives of the seventeenth-century classical ideal, beautifully expressed in the works he painted between Bologna, Rome and Naples.
The composition is set out on two levels, the earthly one and the celestial one, according to the traditional scheme. On the upper level, bathed in bright light, is the Trinity, surrounded by a choir of graceful musician angels.

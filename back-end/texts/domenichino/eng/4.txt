After some attempts at an agreement for the canvas destined for San Giovanni in Monte with Ludovico Carracci and perhaps also with Guido Reni, on November 28, 1617 Lorenzo and Giulio Cesare Ratta finally agreed with Domenichino, who had just arrived in Bologna.
The highly studied and complex composition (numerous preparatory drawings are located in Paris at the Louvre and Windsor Castle) was met with appreciation among contemporaries, but also raised controversy, mainly due to the darkness of the symbols and the significance of the scenes depicted in the lower area.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
The painting was taken from the French in 1796: from Paris, where it was restored (Landon 1803), it was brought back to Bologna in 1815 and housed in the Church of the Holy Spirit. From 1817 it has been continuously exhibited in the Pinacoteca, while in San Giovanni in Monte it was replaced in 1824 by a thirteenth-century Madonna.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

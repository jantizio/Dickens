Domenichino, although portraying a violent scene of torture, avoids any excessively bloody tone and with his classical style, softens the turbulence of the drama: the idea of martyrdom is expressed by emphasizing the difference between the victim’s figure and the executioner sinking the dagger into the saint’s throat, while he forcefully pulls her long hair with his left hand.
The saint, on the other hand, with her ecstatic gaze, is already engulfed in the vision of paradise and the promise of eternal salvation, sealed by the presence of the angel who is receiving the palm of martyrdom from Christ's hands.
In the foreground, next to the stake, which the Saint had miraculously survived, the bodies of two men, probably identifiable with two executioners, lie on the ground.

Destined for the church of San Giovanni in Monte, it was commissioned by the Ratta family in 1617 and concluded between 1621 and 1625.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
It is Monsignor Dionigi Ratta who, in his will, dated 2 November 1597, makes the Chapel in San Giovanni in Monte di Bologna, which corresponds in proportion to that of The Bentivogli Lords, and let him make a painting, or figure of Our Lady of the Rosary, which is beautiful and made by some of the excellent painters, and make in that chapel a noble memory of Mr. Ludovico my father in memory, and honor of which I find myself making it do' (ASBo, De Bosdari, Archivio Ratta, b. 243, n. 51). That is, it was supposed to rise instead of the old sacristy, to face the chapel that had contained Raphael's Santa Cecilia for almost a century and in memory of the one who - who died in 1589 - had been the founder of the family's economic fortunes. In life, Dionigi Ratta had already been the patron in Bologna of the great Transfiguration of Ludovico Carracci for San Pietro Martire, a church that - for the love of his sister Lucrezia, a nun in that convent since 1562 - he himself had had reconstructed on a project by Floriano Ambrosini.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>

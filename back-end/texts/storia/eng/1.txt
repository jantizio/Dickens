The Certosa cemetery of Bologna was established in 1801 upon the remains of the Certosa monastery, built in 1334 and abolished in 1796 with the arrival of Napoleonic troops.
Before its transformation into a cemetery, the San Girolamo of Casara monastery had been for centuries one of the most important buildings in the city and also one of the most famous monasteries of the Carthusian order, known for both the beauty of the architecture and the importance of the preserved art, particularly in San Girolamo church. After the French arrived in Bologna, this monastery, as well as other religious buildings, were used for other, non religious, purposes. The artefacts from the Certosa were either sold or taken to the National Art Gallery. The San Girolamo church was saved from this, and is a testimony today of the lost wealth of the monastery, where remarkable baroque paintings can be admired.

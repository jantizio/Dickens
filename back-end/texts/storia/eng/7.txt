The role of “custode-dimostratore”, a sort of tour guide, a title that is not found in other Italian and European cemeteries, was given for the first time to Raffaele Mazzoli in 1826 following the winning of the first public competition held for the office that had just been established. Raffaele Mazzoli was killed two years later by two construction workers, the sons of Carlo Perucchi, who all worked on the construction of the Pantheon Room. It turned out that the roof of the building was poorly constructed. The Perucchi family were therefore excluded from other construction projects to be carried out in the cemetery and in revenge they killed Raffaele Mazzoli. In November 1828, the municipality launched a competition for the role of ‘custode-dimostratore’, also requiring the candidate to speak French and have an awareness of the culture of the period.

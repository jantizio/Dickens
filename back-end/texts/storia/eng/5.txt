As we read in the book Dickens a Bologna e una visita memorabile alla Certosa by Roberto Martorelli and Valeria Roncuzzi: “Una tranquilla passeggiata in Certosa consentiva così di comprendere lo svolgimento della storia e dell’arte locale dal medioevo all’età contemporanea, in un contesto piacevole, sotto portici e chiostri immersi nel verde.” (A peaceful walk in the Certosa allowed us to understand the transition of local art from the Middle Ages to the modern age, in a pleasant setting under arcades and cloisters surrounded by greenery).
The museum rooms were located at the beginning of the cemetery. During the 1880’s, a reversal of the process that had led to their formation began; the works retrace the journey made at the beginning of the century and many monuments gradually returned to their original locations. Some statues were taken to the Medieval Museum of Bologna and little remains of the museum rooms today. The most intact is the corridor with the “plaques”. The watershed for the museum rooms was in 1870, at that time there were still the skulls mentioned by Byron in his memoirs. After 1870, the monuments began to be moved from these museum rooms.

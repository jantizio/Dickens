Regarding the requirements for candidates for this position, Gian Marco Vidor in his interesting volume Biografia di un cimitero italiano: la Certosa adds that the judges would take into consideration candidates who had a knowledge of arts, Latin and and a foreign language: in 1828 the Sibaud family, of French origin, began to work at the Certosa. The winner of the competition was Germano Sibaud, who was the first of many generations to fulfil this role at the Certosa. He was born in 1780 from Marcellino Sibaud (senior) who moved to Bologna from Brian√ßon, in the French Alps, at the end of the 18th century.

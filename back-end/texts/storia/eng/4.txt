In addition to being the first, and for a long time the only monumental cemetery in Italy, the Certosa has a structure that no other cemetery has: it’s constructed with arcades, giving it the same urban structure as the city of Bologna. On the opening page of his visit to the Certosa, Dickens notes that he walked among majestic colonnades.
Another feature that makes the Certosa unique and explains its fame and why it was a must for visitors in the 19th Century is that it’s like an open air museum: when the churches, according to the motto of the French revolution “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité” were transformed into non religious buildings (houses or barracks for example), large sculptures, funeral monuments, and works of art from inside the churches and monasteries were transported to parts of the Certosa, turning it into a ‘museum’. From 1832, monuments were put in rooms, more specifically museum rooms which contained antiquities divided by century from west to east, following the ideal path of visitors. The museum rooms were therefore important because they told centuries of the history of Bologna making the Certosa the Bolognese museum par excellence.

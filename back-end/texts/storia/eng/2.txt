Napoleon Bonaparte first arrived in Bologna in 1796, when he was commander in chief of the French army involved in the ‘Italian Campaign’. After having triumphantly entered Milan in May, he headed towards Papal State territory, conquering Bologna on the 19th June: he entered the city from Porta San Felice the following day, 20th June 1796. He immediately lapsed the Papal government and temporarily concentrated power in the hands of the Senate, who asked the legal experts of Bologna to draw up a constitutional document that would formalize the new government structure. According to Napoleon's plans, Bologna was to become the capital of the Cispadana Republic, formed by the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, and by the two former ministries of the Papal State (Ferrara and Bologna). The new republic was announced in Reggio Emilia on the 23rd December. On the 7th January 1797, it took the green, white and red horizontal tricolour as its flag: the Cispdana republic was therefore the first republic to officially use the tricolour of future Italy. However, promises of autonomy and a central position of Bologna were not kept for long, and on the 27th July 1797, the Cispadana republic was merged with Cisalpine republic and its capital Milan.

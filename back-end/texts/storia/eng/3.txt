After the abolition of the Certosa Monastery, the municipal government decided to build upon the foundations of the Certosa, transforming it into the only cemetery of the city and closing all the small cemeteries, around the churches and monasteries. It arose in 1801 as the Certosa cemetery of Bologna, which could be considered as the first modern funeral establishment in Europe, as it was inaugurated 3 years before the Napoleonic decree of Saint Cloud, according to which each city had to have only one cemetery and it had to be built in the open countryside for practical and hygienic reasons. With the decree of Saint-Cloud the modern cemetery was born in Europe. The Certosa had been for centuries the only large cemetery in Italy and was founded three years before the famous PÃ¨re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

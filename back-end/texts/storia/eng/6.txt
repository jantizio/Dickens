The “custode-dimostratore”: unique to Bologna<br/>
In the Certosa, 2 families played the role of being caretakers through several generations: the Brasa family and then the Sibaud family.
The Brasa family took care of burials in the cemetery. The first caretaker who went to live there with his family when the Certosa first opened was Giovanni Battisti Brasa, followed by his son Giuseppe, and then his nephew Raffaele, whose role was to be director of the burials and to take care of the archive register. In the book Cose accadute nel tempo di mia vita, Francesco Majani notes that Raffaele had a lot to do in the year of the cholera epidemic, every morning to be present at the burial of so many people, yet, being in contact with all those who died from the disease, didn’t affect him and he remained in good health. Majani says that, initially, it was Giovanni Battista Brasa who also acted as a guide to visitors and took many tips which he used to live off beyond his wages. However, later the Town Hall decided to find a caretaker who could speak French and the role of “tour guide” was removed from the Brasa family and instead they were given the title of “Sovrintendente alle Tumulazioni”,  which allowed them to continue supervising the burials.

TRAVEL ESSENTIALS: As a symbol of the idea of travel ‘par excellence’, perfected over the centuries, from a simple leather case used in the fourteenth century, to a small case inlaid with mother-of-pearl in the seventeenth-eighteenth century. Inside, the most varied objects that the traveller uses on a daily basis are inserted and assembled, in order to take advantage of all the spaces, for example, the necessary for personal hygiene, for writing, for sewing, for drinking tea and coffee. In addition to this, the traveler brought with him:
- portable pharmacies: surgical instruments, bands, gauze, various bottles, pharmaceutical preparations, everything needed to sanitize the rooms of the inns
- portable pantries: necessary for cooking and for seasoning food
- miniature libraries made up of small volumes
- painting equipment: box of watercolor paints and a folder of sheets.

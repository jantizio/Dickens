Lord Byron travelled in his "Napoleonic" white carriage, built in London by the famous builder Baxter, a sort of ante-litteram camper with bed and provisions, with the servants and his menagerie of animals that were used for recreation and cooking in another carriage, Dickens and his family moved in an elegant carriage drawn by four horses with leather liquor holders and lamps for day and night. On long journeys he undertook alone in the main cities of the peninsula, after having left his family in Genoa, Dickens instead used mail carriages, that is, used for public service.

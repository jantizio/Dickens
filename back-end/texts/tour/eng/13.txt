The journey could be tiring and dangerous. Thieves were always present in the streets and it was necessary to pay close attention to the types of beds that the inns and refreshment places offered to travelers, often "inhabited" by bedbugs and fleas, due to the inconvenience of travelling crammed with other people for several weeks. Weather conditions also played a role in the type of carriage chosen, in terms of safety, comfort and effectiveness in suspensions, considering the often bumpy roads of the time and the difficulties associated with traveling some sections such as crossing alpine passes (where travellers often got off the carriage and instead glided downstream on sleds) or crossing rivers (since many bridges were made of wood and were not safe, travelers dismounted from the carriage and crossed using barges).

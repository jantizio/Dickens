For the journey from Piacenza to Parma Dickens uses "the highest mail carriage ever seen", equipped with a good courier, while the postillion was "the quintessence" of all the ragamuffin in Italy.
“Never while the brave Courier lives! Behold him jingling out of Piacenza, and staggering this way, in the tallest posting-chaise ever seen, so that he looks out of the front window as if he were peeping over a garden wall; while the postillion, concentrated essence of all the shabbiness of Italy, pauses for a moment in his animated conversation, to touch his hat to a blunt-nosed little Virgin, hardly less shabby than himself, enshrined in a plaster Punch’s show outside the town.”<sup><a href='#3'>3</a></sup>

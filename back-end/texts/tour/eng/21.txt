Before Dickens, many great writers and intellectuals made a stop in Italy as part of the Grand Tour. Among the greatest: Goethe, Stendhal, Lord Byron.<br/>

Wolfgang Goethe's trip to Italy lasted almost two years, from 3 September 1786 to 18 June 1788, that is, one year, nine months and fifteen days. The first stay lasted four months, the second almost ten months. The Italian cities involved in Goethe's Grand Tour included Trento, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Venice, Florence, Milan, Como, Naples, Palermo, Agrigento, Catania, Rome, where he spent most of his time. Goethe's Roman home has now become an interesting museum.<br/>

Goethe stayed in Bologna from 18 to 20 October 1786 and, again, on his return journey after visiting the cities of the south, from 12 to 21 May 1788. Goethe recorded his travel impressions in a diary published in 1829, in which he did not give a description of the country as much as, rather, of the impressions it had received from the country and from the people, mixed with reflections on art, culture and literature.

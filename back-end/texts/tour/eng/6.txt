DOCUMENTS FOR TRAVELLING: To travel, you needed a passport, an important guarantee in the event of police checks and conflicts with hosts or carriers, and an entry visa. Passports and entry visas were also required to rent carriages and horses, as well as to obtain hospitality in the inns. A health bulletin was also required, which prevented the traveller from being quarantined in case he arrived by sea.

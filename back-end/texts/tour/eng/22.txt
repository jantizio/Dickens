Henri Beyle Stendhal was in Bologna for the first time between 23 and 25 September 1811, coming from Milan. Staying at the Royal Hotel (San Marco), he was especially struck by the richness of the museums: in addition to the Academy Art Gallery, he visited some important private galleries. Stendhal returned to Bologna in October 1814, coming from Florence via the Futa. He had the opportunity to learn more about art treasures and monuments. He gave a good impression of the city and of the Bolognese women, whom he compared in beauty and elegance to the Parisians. Among the things that struck him was the rich offer of shows and musical academies, so much so that he defined Bologna as "the headquarters of music in Italy", dominated by the universal genius Rossini. Between the end of December 1816 and January 18, 1817 Stendhal was again a guest in Bologna and returned several more times, in 1819, 1820, 1831. The last known stop was in the second fortnight of October 1835, during a transfer to Ravenna. Bologna will always remain for him a pleasant city, although dominated by "priests", one of the centers of Italian civilization, "une ville de gens d'esprit".<sup><a href='#6'>6</a></sup>

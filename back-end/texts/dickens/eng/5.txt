<h5><u>Realism</u></h5><br/>
He is usually defined as a “realist novelist” but, if we compare him with his contemporary European writers, we see that he is a <b>“Victorian” realist</b>, with all the typical Victorian repugnance for the “realistic” representations of sexuality and depravation. <br/>
He is quite meticulous about details, especially when he describes London slums, but the most repugnant objects are never specifically mentioned.<br/>
As in Dostoevsky, there are criminals also in Dickens. But, while in the Russian writer their most frequent crime is either a murder or a rape, in Dickens it is only a murder, since rape is connected with sex and therefore avoided.

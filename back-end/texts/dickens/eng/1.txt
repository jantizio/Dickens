<u><h5>Life and works</u></h5><br/><br/>
Charles Dickens was born near Portsmouth, on the south cost of England. He had an unhappy childhood, since his father went to prison for debt and he had to work in a factory at the age of 12. The factory was dirty and cold, and he felt humiliated. These painful experiences marked the beginning of Dickens’s social commitment and identification with the poor and the oppressed, which are constantly present in his fiction, and are recorded in David Copperfield. <br/>
At the age of 16 he was apprenticed in a lawyer’s office. When he realised that he had a talent for writing he learnt shorthand and became a reporter in the courts of law and a journalist in 1830. These experiences provided the material for the description of lawyers and their world in many of his novels.<br/>
He visited America twice. He travelled in Switzerland, France and Italy and wrote Pictures from Italy, an illuminating account of his experiences in Italy. <br/>
He died in 1870 leaving The Mystery of Edwin Drood unfinished. He was buried in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey.

<h5><u>Style</u></h5><br/>
His style is characterised by the use of metaphors (for example, in Hard Times the shaft into which Stephen Blackpool stumbles and dies becomes a metaphor for the industrial system which, like a black well, engulfs and destroys human lives), a very effective language, a careful choice of adjectives, repetitions of words and structures. His love for exaggeration create a tragic-comic vision of the Victorian world.

<h5><u>His characters and setting</u></h5><br/>
Dickens’s world is inhabited by hundreds of characters drawn from the observation of real people. His characters may be roughly divided into good and evil.<br/>
He mainly described the characters, habits and language of the middle, lower and also the lowest classes in London, and was always on the side of the poor. In his novels, the 18th century realistic upper middle-class world was replaced by the lower-class one.<br/>
He shows his greatest talent when he portrays minor characters, depicted with a sympathetic or humorous or satirical tone. A good example is the character of Mr Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, a minor character in the story who comes to life more vividly than the hero himself. He is the typical villain, a flat character that never changes throughout the story, but has a great vitality. <br/>
Another important characteristic is Dickens’ great observation and powerful description of the environment, such as the urban slums and the destruction caused by industrialism on the landscape.

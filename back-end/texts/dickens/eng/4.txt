<b>Themes</b><br/><br/>
The most frequently recurring <b>themes</b> in his novels are <b>childhood </b> and <b>social criticism</b>.<br/>
Some of Dickens’s novels are defined as social or humanitarian. He used fiction to denounce the vices and evils of his age, the spiritual and material corruption of his time under the impact of industrialism and showed a critical attitude towards his society. London was the setting of most of his novels and his recurrent themes are the exploitation and ill-treatment of children, the monstrosity of children’s work in mines and factories for 14 or 15 hours a day, the inhumanity of workhouses, the evils caused by an outdated system of justice, etc.<br/>
<b>Children</b> occupy a remarkable portion of his novels, first of all because many novels follow the protagonist from his childhood to maturity (David Copperfield, for example, begins with the protagonist birth), secondly because in the period of the industrial revolution there was a feeling of sentimental benevolence towards the sufferings of the so many children who started working at the age of 5 or 6, finally because Dickens’s hard experience as a child had marked him for ever. His children are creatures sometimes destroyed by life and sometimes miraculously rescued by somebody’s unexpected intervention after they have suffered all sorts of misadventures. Examples of the second type are Oliver Twist or David Copperfield.<br/>
However, although he was an effective critic of the injustices of Victorian society, he was no revolutionary and never questioned the basic values of his time. He shared the contemporary, optimistic view that the secret of happiness was in hard work, romantic love and family life. In fact, many of his books, like Nicholas Nickleby, have a fairy-tale quality, with good triumphing over evil and being rewarded by financial security. Dickens therefore had a double attitude towards Victorian society.<br/>

He engaged in welfare projects, such as slum clearance, schools for poor children, etc. and exerted a great influence on the reform movement of his age.

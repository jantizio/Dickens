Dickens wrote many works and mainly novels, all characterised by <b>elaborate plots</b> and a <b>unique sense of humour</b>. His novels were all published <b>in serial form</b>. He wrote:
<b><u>HUMOROUS NOVELS</u></b>, such as The Pickwick Papers (1836-7), that was Dickens’s first real success. <br/>
<b><u>HISTORICAL NOVELS</u></b>, such as A Tale of Two Cities (1859), which takes place in London and in Paris at the time of the French Revolution.<br/>
<b><u>SENTIMENTAL NOVELS</u></b>, such as
A Christmas Carol (1843), a ghost story with a moral, set in the atmosphere of Christmas. David Copperfield (1849-50), his best-known work. It’s his most autobiographical novel and revisits his painful childhood.<br/>
<b><u>SOCIAL OR HUMANITARIAN NOVELS</u></b>, such as<br/>
<b><i>Oliver Twist</i></b>, (1837-38), in which, through the story of an orphan boy, Oliver, born in a workhouse, an institution for poor people, Dickens attacks the workhouse system and denounces the bitter reality of slums and the degradation of poverty. He also wanted to criticise Victorian policy towards the poor and attack the inhumanity of the Poor Law (1834), according to which the poor could only receive assistance if they moved into workhouses. Much of the first part of Oliver Twist criticises these organisations run by church and government which were usually very severe places: children were separated from their families and put into forced labour. These “charitable” institutions reproduced the horrible conditions in which the poor would have lived in any case. Dickens uses Oliver’s character to challenge the Victorian idea that the poor and criminals are already evil at birth; according to Dickens, in fact, the real source of vice is a corrupt environment.<br/>
<b><i>Nicholas Nickleby</b></i>, (1838-39), which is a lively, humorous novel with an attractive young hero. It shows the ill-treatment and exploitation of poor children.<br/>
<b><i>Bleak House</b></i> (1852-3), against the abuses of the law. It offers a satirical portrait of the world around the courts of law.<br/>
<b><i>Hard Times</b></i> (1854) shows the class struggle in industrial society and denounces the terrible conditions of industrial workers. <br/>
<b><i>Little Dorrit</b></i> (1855-57) is mainly set in Marshalsea prison where Dickens’s father had spent some time and denounces the horrible conditions of prisons in general. <br/>
<b><i>Great Expectations</b></i> (1860-61), by many considered his masterpiece, is the last of the 3 novels written in the form of an autobiography (the other 2 are Bleak House and David Copperfield). It is about the dramatic experiences of a young boy (Pip) as he gradually and painfully grows up. This novel can be considered as a “novel of formation or apprenticeship novel” (Bildungsroman, that is a novel that follows the development of the hero from childhood to adulthood), since the book starts when Pip is only 7 years old, follows him through various experiences and leaves him a different character. The novel is written in the first person narrator/protagonist and contains many autobiographical elements, including his working experience in the hated factory.

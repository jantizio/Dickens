Starting from the second half of the last century, the planted area began to gradually contract for several reasons: the decline of sharecropping, the specialization of agriculture, the high management costs, new needs related to the mechanization of agriculture. All this has meant that many “plantings” have been demolished or relegated to the role of "relict crop". The disappearance does not simply mean the loss of a piece of historical memory, but also the loss of an important habitat for the bird species that lived there. Some of these have managed, not without difficulty, to adapt to living in orchards, but others have been heavily penalized by the disappearance of this important nesting site. Many of these species, being insectivores, contributed to the containment of insect populations harmful to agricultural activity. In some environments, farmers have introduced artificial nests into their orchards, favoring the return of insectivorous birds.<br/>
The motorization, the large harvesting machines, the diffusion of fuels other than wood, the ease of transport that allows the use of exotic woods for buildings, have nullified the reasons that kept alive a millenary crop that has been able to brilliantly cope the need for strategic resources (food and timber) for a rapidly growing population without exhausting their source. Today the few remaining “Piantate” are relics of this centuries-old history in a plain landscape transformed into a sort of cereal steppe; many are badly reduced, barely hinted at; those still in production with elms and lozenge-shaped shoots between one tree and another represent the romantic obstinacy of old peasants, now tenants or owners of the farm worked for generations by the owner, irreducible to the pure logic of economic convenience.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

"In Genoa, and thereabouts, they train the vines on trellis-work, supported on square clumsy pillars, which, in themselves, are anything but picturesque. But, here, they twine them around trees, and let them trail among the hedges; and the vineyards are full of trees, regularly planted for this purpose, each with its own vine twining and clustering about it. Their leaves are now of the brightest gold and deepest red; and never was anything so enchantingly graceful and full of beauty. Through miles of these delightful forms and colors, the road winds its way. The wild festoons, the elegant wreaths, and crowns, and garlands of all shapes; the fairy nets flung over great trees, and making them prisoners in sport; the tumbled heaps and mounds of exquisite shapes upon the ground; how rich and beautiful they are! And every now and then, a long, long line of trees, will be all bound and garlanded together: as if they had taken hold of one another, and were coming dancing down the field!”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup><br/><br/>
If we compare recent aerial photos with aerial photos from the 1930s, we see that, in the latter, the presence of vine rows along the dividing line between one field and another is very widespread. With the disappearance of the “Piantata”, the Padano landscape has radically changed, because the mechanization of agricultural work has made room for itself within the centuries, upsetting a millenary landscape, also because there was a complete lack of education to maintain our cultural and landscape identity.

To find out where the “Piantata” originates from, it is necessary to go back to the time of the Etruscans, who used to marry the vines to tree stakes; the Gauls, which came to the Etruscans starting from the 4th century BC, received the type of cultivation consisting of the vine supported by the elm, subsequently called by the Romans arbustum gallicum. The Latin agronomists - Cato, Columella, Pliny and others - indicate precisely as arbustum gallicum the practice of cultivating the vine using trees as supports or guardians.<br/><br/>
Thus, also in Roman times, what for us Bolognese will become “the Piantata” is consolidated and which, after the long period of the early Middle Ages, will reappear in a relevant way in the Emilian Plain in the 11th and 12th centuries. The cultivation of live-supported vines, whose rows marked the individual fields cultivated with cereals in regular sequence, then continues to have an ever greater success over time, as it proved to be particularly functional to the type of sharecropping farming, which became prevalent being suitable following the periodic pruning and cutting of trees, a precious supply of wood that can be used for domestic heating, for cooking or for the construction of various types of tools. The trees mainly used in the “Piantata” were the Elm and the Field Maple, the latter called by the farmers Opi. Elm leaves could be used as fresh fodder for livestock.

The spread of the vine married to an arboreal tutor continued in Emilia until around 1870 when the large tree-free area began to become the characteristic landscape of recently reclaimed land and when the progress of hempiculture challenged the custom of associating the rows vines to hemp plants as the dense intertwining of the roots and the shadow cast by the foliage on the crops decreased the productivity of the latter. The contraction of the planting in Emilia then continued in the early decades of the twentieth century and in the thirties of the same century it was accelerated by a serious disease of the Elms called graphiosis: the traditional rows thus began to be replaced by specialized vineyards supported by poles, first of wood then in concrete, and occupying entire fields more comfortable to cultivate and today completely prevalent.

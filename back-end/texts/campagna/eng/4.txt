In the sixteenth century the landscape of the “Piantata” now extended like an orderly productive forest from Veneto and Emilia to Lombardy and this circumstance contributed to giving the countryside that tidy appearance punctuated by regular fields, paths, cavedagne, scolina sunken with the banks flanked precisely by the rows of vines that distinguished it until the second post-war period, that is, until before the advent of massive mechanization. In fact, in the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, the literary and documentary testimonies show us the system of the “Piantata” in progressive and constant expansion in the northern plains to the point of becoming, together with the cereal field, the foundation of seventeenth-century Bolognese agriculture.

From the book Pictures of Italy, dedicated to the visit to the Certosa, we imagine that Dickens saw Marcellino Sibaud at the end of the portico in Chiostro Terzo.
“There was such a very smart official in attendance at the Cemetery where the little Cicerone had buried his children, that when the little Cicerone suggested to me, in a whisper, that there would be no offence in presenting this officer, in return for some slight extra service, with a couple of pauls (about tenpence, English money), I looked incredulously at his cocked hat, wash-leather gloves, well-made uniform, and dazzling buttons, and rebuked the little Cicerone with a grave shake of the head. For, in splendour of appearance, he was at least equal to the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod;<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> and the idea of his carrying, as Jeremy Diddler<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> would say, “such a thing as tenpence” away with him, seemed monstrous. He took it in excellent part, however, when I made bold to give it him, and pulled off his cocked hat with a flourish that would have been a bargain at double the money.”<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
Marcellino Sibaud was very grateful for the tip offered to him by Dickens, because the Municipality of Bologna only provided the caretaker/guide with accommodation in the Certosa, they were not paid with a salary. Therefore he appreciated any tips that visitors gave him.

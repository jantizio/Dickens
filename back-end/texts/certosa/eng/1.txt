A real open air museum, the <a href="/storia">Certosa</a> was a favourite destination for the rich and famous visiting Bologna throughout the nineteenth century. Before Charles Dickens, it was visited among others, by <a href="/byron">Lord Byron</a>, a great British poet and politician and one of the biggest representatives of English Romanticism, and by Jules Janin, writer and playwright, leading figures of French Romanticism, who have left written traces of their walk in the monumental cemetery.
Let’s imagine that Dickens arrived to the Certosa on foot because he loved to walk, entering either from the main entrance or from the Piangoloni entrance, also known as “the entrance of the dead” or, much more likely, along the portico of San Luca starting from Porta Saragozza, more protected and more enjoyable. He probably continued his walk along the nineteenth century portico of the Certosa, built between 1811 and 1834 (and born from an idea of the architect and engineer Ercole Gasparini.) He was the first architect involved in the Certosa, and made adaptations to the ancient monastery that once occupied the space. Gasparini had the idea of constructing a portico that connected the Certosa to the Meloncello arch and, through the portico of San Luca, to the city, thus connecting the “city of the living” with the “city of the dead”.

Marcellino Sibaud will have then led Dickens along the Chiostro I dâ€™Ingresso, the first funeral chiostro after the museum rooms, and then up to the Pantheon or the  Sala dei Bolognesi illustri, now completely modified, and then to the Sala delle Tombe, overlooking the chiostro. Dickens was able to admire this grand hall, built from 1816 in the monks living room. However at the time of his visit, the magnificent statue of the lion in memory of the fallen for the independence of Italy, was missing. It can now be admired at the back of the room, located there after 1873. From the Sala delle Tombe, they will have headed to the splendid Sala Catacombe, located where there were originally the rooms of four monks of the ancient monastery. The room was completed in 1833 and then underwent several reconstructions over the years.

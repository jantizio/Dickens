With his first companion, Dickens first went along a nineteenth-century corridor, then the Pantheon field (which is now Chiostro VI, or the fallen of the Great War), where at the time there was almost nothing. He probably focused on the 1920’s monument on the left. Turning right, he will have visited the rooms of the monks and nuns. After 1801, some of the cells in the monastery were used to showcase skulls with the names of the once living people on them. This peculiarity struck many foreign travellers, and among the most famous was Ħ/byronΩ Lord ByronĦ in 1819. We do not know if the skulls were shown to Dickens and how many there were. In the area where the nuns and Capuchin monks lived, Dickens admired the monument of the Prior Giuseppe Vogli.
(1811-1813), masterpiece by the famous sculptor Giacomo De Maria.

“He had no pace at all; no more than a tortoise. He loitered as the people loitered, that they might gratify their curiosity; and positively allowed them, now and then, to read the inscriptions on the tombs. He was neither shabby, nor insolent, nor churlish, nor ignorant. He spoke his own language with perfect propriety, and seemed to consider himself, in his way, a kind of teacher of the people, and to entertain a just respect both for himself and them.”<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>
Going back along the arcade, in one of the two corridors that go from Chiostro Terzo to Chiostro V, Dickens wil have been shown the  Pizzardi monument, a marble masterpiece sculpted around 1842 by Cincinnato Baruzzi (1796-1878) who was a pupil of Canova and one of the greatest sculptors of the time and the only Bolognese sculptor to be assigned noble works from Popes and Kings all over the world. The work represents a modern concept, a symbolic representation of an allegory of Industry with classical symbols. The cornucopia at the foot of the statue is a symbol of abundance.

From the Sala Ellittica room, you arrive at Chiostro Terzo (also known as the Chapel), built during the extension constructed to the Carthusian Monastery, that began in the mid-fifthteenth century and ended in 1588. A member of the Sibaud family showed Dickens Chiostro Terzo, where the children were buried, on one side the boys and on the other the girls. Dickens refers to it when he asks the little Cicerone who was buried there, and he shows him the lawn where his five children are buried.
“Only the poor, Signore! It’s very cheerful. It’s very lively. How green it is, how cool! It’s like a meadow! There are five, - holding up all the fingers of his right hand to express the number, which an Italian peasant will always do, if it be within the compass of his ten fingers, - “there are of my little children buried there, Signore; just there; a little to the right.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
Infant mortality was very high at that time. Life expectancy in Dickens’s time was 40 years old, and even lower for the poor.

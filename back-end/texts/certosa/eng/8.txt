Seeing that Dickens was sorry for the loss of his children, the little Cicerone “made a little bow; partly in deprecation of his having alluded to such a subject, and partly in memory of the children and of his favourite saint. It was as unaffected and as perfectly natural a little bow, as ever man made. Immediately afterwards, he took his hat off altogether, and begged to introduce me to the next monument; and his eyes and his teeth shone brighter than before.”5
Chiostro Terzo is the fulcrum of the cemetery. A reflection of the local neoclassical culture, where the initial painted tombs (first established in 1801), were then replaced by works made of plaster and scagliola. Later on in the mid nineteenth century, they were replaced again with works made of marble and bronze.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the monuments were painted. However after the fall of Napoleon, this began to change. Passing from the French to the papacy, painted monuments were replaced by sculptures. Marble was a valuable material and so a sculpture made of it was a symbol of economic well-being, and represented important, rich families, while plaster sculptures would represent less wealthy families.

Marcellino will have of course showed Dickens the grand Sala del Colombario, whose construction started in 1833. Therefore at the time of Dickens’ visit, it was already there and should have been around halfway built (construction started when the spaces for the tombs began to be sold). It is one of the most evocative places in the Certosa. The slender columns of the side arches allow a glimpse of the tombstones and the inscriptions, while in the centre of the corridor and the alcoves, stand some of the most beautiful monuments in the Certosa. It is in fact one of the largest covered spaces in Bologna. The structure vaguely resembles ancient roman temples or baths, there is nothing religious about their design. Even though Bologna returned to a Papal state after the downfall of Napoleon, the idea of the cemetery remains secular. The statue at the end of the first part of the building is noteworthy: the Malvezzi-Angelelli marble monument, completed in 1854 but begun in 1833: probably at the time of Dickens’s visit the base was already there. The upper part was to be a funeral monument of Elisa Bonaparte, one of Napoleon’s sisters by the sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini (1770-1850), much appreciated by Elisa Bonaparte, who in 1807 had him appointed director of the Sculpture School of the Academy of Fine Arts of Carrara. This monument, only dedicated to Elisa Bonaparte, was rejected by the family because Elisa’s husband had also died in the meantime. In the chapel of San Giacomo (Cappella Baciocchi) in the Basilica of San Petronio, there is the tomb of Elisa Bonaparte, her husband Felice Baciocchi, and their children. The statue initially dedicated to Elisa was bought by Marchese Massimiliano Angelelli, who then asked Massimiliano Putti (1809-1890) to adapt the group, changed into  “Pallade e il Genio della Gloria”. Massimiliano Putti was also the creator of the base with the elegant medallion with the sculpture of Angelelli.

According to the Sibaud’s way of showing visitors the most notable works present in the Certosa, from the Sala del Colombario, Marcellino and his visitors would have then returned to the Chiostro Terzo to admire some of the precious marble monuments that were already present at the time that Dickens visited. In the Chiostro Terzo, the monument of the Marescotti family (first half of the nineteenth century), will most likely have been shown to Dickens. It is a colossal and refined sculpture that was among the few marble statues in the Certosa present at the time. Created by the carrarese sculptor Carl Chelli (1807-1877) in 1844, then finished in the year of Dickens’ visit. Carlo Chelli had come to Bologna to work in the workshop of the sculptor Cincinnato Baruzzi. The most prestigious piece is at the top and represents a god of ancient times holding an oar, a symbolic representation of the science of navigation.

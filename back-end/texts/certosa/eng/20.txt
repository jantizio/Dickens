Having reached Chiostro V, at the end of the portico, Marcellino will have shown the Rossini Colbran monument (1823), depicting the first wife of the great italian composer <a href="/rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a> who lived in Bologna for decades: a monument that links a series of themes of the period. This tomb is dedicated to Rossini and his first wife Isabella Colbran, a great Spanish opera singer, to his wifeâ€™s father, a Spanish cellist. In the tomb lies the remains of his first wife, his father and parents. The sculpture represents a symbolic representation of sad music. The monument was made by the sculptor Del Rosso, from carrara.

The little Cicerone probably showed Dickens the most important painted monuments you can admire in Chiostro Terzo, in particular:
The Martinelli monument
Vincenzo Martinelli was the most famous landscape painter in Bologna in the second half of the eighteenth century. After his death in 1807, the Municipality dedicated an arch in Chiostro Terzo to him. The work was created by Pietro Fancelli (1764-1850) and Luigi Busatti (1763-1821) in honour of their teacher. 
The Mondini monument
A mural painting dedicated to the medicine professor Carlo Mondini (1729-1803), by Petronio Rizzi and Bartolomeo Valiani in around 1803.

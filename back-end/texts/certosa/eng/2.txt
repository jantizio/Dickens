In the 19th century, the Certosa was always closed except on holidays. Dickens visited it on Sunday 10th November 1844, which was All Saints’ Day, meaning all the entrances were open and there was a large influx of people. If, as we imagine, he turned right from the Meloncello arch, and then walked through more than 700m of porticoes that lead to the Cemetery, Dickens did not enter from the main entrance, but from the Monumental Entrance. This would explain the fact that he was accompanied on his first visit by an unofficial guide (the “little Cicerone”), before meeting the caretaker/guide <a href="/sibaud">Marcellino Sibaud</a>, who generally welcomed guests at the main entrance in the church square (where he also used to live).

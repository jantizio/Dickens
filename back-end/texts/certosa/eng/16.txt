The monument of the Marescotti family is located next to the Cappella dei Suffragi, overlooking the centre of the south side of the chiostro and designed by the architect Angelo Gasparini (1771-1829). This very elegant architecture in which the ceremonies were performed (because it was in line with the Piangoloni entrance and therefore the funeral procession had access to it), was unfortunately demolished in the 1860â€™s to expand the Cemetery. The current altar is not what Dickens saw. In a reconstruction, an attempt was made to maintain the previous architectural style: for example the style of the capitals is the same as those of the facade (which is the original one).

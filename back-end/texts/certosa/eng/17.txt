Having turned the chiostro terzo along the east side, the guide will have probably shown Dickens the Tadeusz Matuszewic monument (1765-1819), an important Polish diplomat who moved to Bologna for its milder climate, and where he died in 1819. The monument was built around 1820 and the inscription is bilingual: in both Latin, the language of intellectuals, and French, the international language of the time.

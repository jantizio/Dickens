Turning back, Dickens will have walked through and admired the evocative elliptical room (Sala Ellittica) designed by Luigi Marchesini (1796-1882) in 1834, in which the Accursi Monument, c. 1833, is particularly noteworthy. The work of the Bolognese sculptor Vincenzo Testoni (1801-1875) is dedicated to the lawyer Domenico Accursi, who died in 1832. This monument is located in a corner, and is composed of a base with an inscription on which the sculpture is placed. In the centre, is the head and shoulders of Domenico Accursi, with illustrations placed on each side to celebrate his loss.

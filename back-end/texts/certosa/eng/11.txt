Dickens then continued his visit with Marcellino Sibaud, who seemed to have the role of showing visitors the funeral monuments. Marcellino most likely guided him towards the church courtyard, which is where the visit usually began, and you could find museum rooms here at the time that Dickens visited, however now there is no remaining trace of these rooms. After the ecclesiastical rooms were removed by the French, the museum rooms housed large sculptures, funeral monuments and works of art taken from churches and convents. It was beginning in 1832 that the monuments began to be displayed here, the antiquities being divided by century from west to east. These rooms were important because they told centuries of the history of Bologna and how the Certosa was made into a Bolognese museum. Around the 1880’s, many of the monuments were gradually returned to their original locations, for example the tomb dedicated to Rolandino de’ Romanzi (m. 1284), a famous medieval “Glossator” of the Bolognese “scuola di Diritto dello Studio” which was taken back to the Church of San Francesco in 1894.

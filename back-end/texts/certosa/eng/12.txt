Of the museum rooms of the past, the most intact today is the corridor where dozens of plaques coming from the ecclesiastical buildings no longer in use and ranging from the 13th to the 18th century, among which there is the plaque of the famous castrated singer Antonio Bernacchi, teacher of the more famous Carlo Broschi.
From this corridor, you can access Chiostro del 1500, a large courtyard where you can see 16th century funeral monuments taken from churches, including San Francesco. The many works of art that used to be found here are also mentioned in some letters that Marcellino Sibaud wrote. According to him, this chiostro should always be closed because the monuments were very valuable and needed to be kept safe.

The way in which the Sibauds’ linger on and highlight the most valuable monuments while diverting the attention of visitors from the less interesting ones described by Dickens is confirmed by the letters from the caretaker. For example in a letter sent to the Municipality of Bologna on November 16th 1838, Germano Sibaud, father of Marcellino, writes that he had the honour of being “custode dimostratore” of the Certosa cemetery and he was keen to show the visitors the most beautiful monuments and explain in detail the history behind them.

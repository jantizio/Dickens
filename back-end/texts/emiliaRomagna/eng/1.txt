The Grand Tour was a long journey through continental Europe undertaken by the wealthy of the northern European aristocracy, particularly British, starting in the 17th century and intended to perfect their knowledge. As an educational and formative experience, the trip could last from a few months to several years, and the main destinations were France, Greece and, above all, Italy, with its rich heritage of ancient Roman and Greek monuments. Between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a trip to this beautiful country became an almost obligatory stage in the education of young people from wealthy English, French and German families, to complete the traditional instruction by private teachers. The preferred Italian destinations were Venice, Rome, Florence, Naples and Bologna, the latter also by virtue of its geographical position and its fame linked in particular to the University and to a glorious tradition that consecrates it as Alma Mater Studiorum. <a href="/tour">More information</a>

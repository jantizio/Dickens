The altarpiece with the Madonna, Child and Saints Francis, Dominic, and Magdalen is the first signed and dated by Ludovico Carracci, who made it for the Bargellini family of Bologna.
The family was tied to the late Pope, Gregory XIII, also Bolognese, through the relationship with the client, Cecilia Bargellini Boncompagni, here shown kneeling at the centre with her hands clasped, as a Carmelite nun.
The work originally stood on the altar of the Boncompagni Chapel in the church of Santi Filippo e Giacomo, on Via delle Lame, also known as “delle convertite”, named after the adjacent convent of the Carmelite Nuns.
Mary, seated on a high throne, adorned by the heraldic dragon of the pope's family, is portrayed as a humble queen, barefoot with a florid face, as she is being crowned by angels in flight; the view from beneath and looking upward makes it tangible and realistic.

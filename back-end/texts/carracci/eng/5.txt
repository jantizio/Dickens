The Transfiguration was commissioned for the high altar of San Pietro Martire by the Bolognese prelate Dionigio Ratta, who had the church built at his expense between 1592 and 1598.
Although other Bolognese artists asked for a lower fee than that of the three Carracci, Ratta was firmly determined to obtain the painting from one of them and, after initial contact with all three Carracci, the work was performed by Ludovico.
The agreement with the painter is dated January 10, 1595, the balance is march 4 of the following year: (ASBo, De Bosdari, Ratta Archive, b. 242, n. 2).<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
The immense canvas is painted in a boldly declamatory style, with titanic figures and a clearly tripartite vertical design, with large crosshastures entirely painted in bright colors. The size of the figures on the plane is greater than that of the figures in the skies. The apostles are much more imposing and present an energetic pose, and the colors of their drapes are more saturated and aggressive. 
The altarpiece shows that Ludovico is more 'baroque' than all the other reformers of the late sixteenth century, not except his cousins. While in his early works much of the content and communicative power was transmitted by the very expressive heads, now Ludovico depersonalizes the figures and takes away emphasis on the faces. The setting is also abstract.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>

The Madonna has her cheek against the Child's and watches us with a direct gaze. Jesus, restless in his mother's lap blesses, while, like a party, the angels sing to the sweet sound of the lute or scatter incense and flowers.
The faithful are called to participate in the event, thanks to the continuity between the painted space and the real world, obtained through the saints’ eloquent gestures.
St. Francis is deeply concentrated on contemplating the Virgin and Child. Saint Dominic, however, turns to the faithful and points out the mother and son to them with an emphatic gesture.
Mary Magdalen, the redeemed prostitute figure par excellence, isolated on the right, seems to be indicating to the Holy family the penitents in prayer beyond the borders of the painting. Her presence is a clear reference to the convent’s function as a charitable refuge for repentant prostitutes.
Justified in the same light is the presence of the holy water and holy water sprinkler at the feet of the Virgin, clear symbols of purification.
Despite the strong human characterization of the saints, like the heavily-lined face of St. Francis or the resolute gaze of St. Dominic, the only true portrait is that of the elderly Cecilia Bargellini Boncompagni, who commissioned the painting, and on whose profile the painter does not fail to record a small wart above her mouth. The sacred characters are offered to the observer in the most confidential and engaging manner, under a portico that alludes to those in the city, beyond which rise the familiar towers of Bologna.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

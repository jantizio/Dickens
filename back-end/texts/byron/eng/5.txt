In 1798, at age 10, George inherited the title and estate of his great-uncle, William Byron, and was officially recognized as Lord Byron. Two years later, he attended Harrow School in London, and in 1803, Byron fell deeply in love with his distant cousin, Mary Chaworth, and this unrequited passion found expression in several poems, including “Hills of Annesley” and “The Adieu”.
From 1805 to 1808, Byron attended Trinity College intermittently, and fell deep into debt, as well as indulging in the conventional vices of undergraduates there. During this time, he found diversion from school and partying with boxing, horse riding and gambling. Byron's first volume of poems, Fugitive Pieces, was privately printed in 1806.

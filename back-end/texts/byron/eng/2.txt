The hotel began to be mentioned in 1661 with the name “albergo della Posta”, and boasted a beautiful building equipped with all the commodities. Byron was among the most famous guests, as you can see in the plaque in the hotel reception, with the inscription by Carducci and commissioned by the owner Rivaldi. The plaque is placed on the façade of the current building and recalls the presence of the Pellegrino hotel from 1500 to 1930. The original work has been kept inside the building since 1886. The Pellegrino hotel also hosted Casanova, Dickens and Mozart (when he was just 14 years old) in 1770.

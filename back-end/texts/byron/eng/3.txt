During this trip to Bologna, Byron spent most of his time indoors, having breakfast in the hotel at 8 am and then going to see the Countess. He visited the Pinacoteca dell'Accademia where he admired Domenichino and Reni’s paintings, and went to the Certosa where he met a caretaker that looked like the undertaker in Hamlet who had a collection of skulls of “Cappuccini” monks. In each of them you could read the name of the monk it belonged to.

In fact, in the book Biografia di un cimitero italiano. La certosa di Bologna, Gian Marco Vidor points out that Lord Byron didn’t meet any member of the Sibaud family as they were yet to arrive. However, the one he described as Hamlet’s undertaker was probably Giovanni Battista Brasa. 
The caretaker showed him a selection of skulls and, in particular, the one of his best friend Desiderio Berò, a monk who brought joy and happiness everywhere he went. According to Byron, it was Brasa who planted and looked after the cypress trees in the Certosa.

Byron left Bologna on the 18th June, heading for Ravenna. He then returned to Bologna on 10th August to 15th September 1819, and during this visit he met the highest Bolognese intellectuals. 

In October 1821, it was Byron’s last visit to Bologna, passing through Pisa. In the "City of Sausages", he made another visit to the Certosa.

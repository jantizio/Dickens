“Dicono che Bologna era la città preferita da Byron e, senza voler decidere se tal gusto è in tutto ragionevole, affermo che lo si comprende facilmente” (A. Valery)                               They say that Bologna was Byron’s favourite city, and it is easy to understand why. 

George Gordon Byron, the most famous European romantic writer, travelled extensively through Italy living in Rome, Ravenna, Bologna, Pisa, Genoa and Venice. 

His first visit to Bologna was in April 1817. On his journey from Venice to Rome, he stopped in Ferrara where he visited the prison cell of Torquato Tasso, drawing inspiration for his poem The Lament of Tasso which he then wrote as soon as he arrived in Bologna. On this occasion he stayed only briefly in the city, walking under the arcades and visiting the Anatomical Museum at the Institute of Science. 

Considered as the Napoleon of literature, Byron is well known and appreciated amongst Bolognese intellectuals. During a visit to the city in January 1817, Stendhal remembers having attended with great pleasure the public reading of his poem Parisina, from which in 1833, Gaetano Donizetti would make an Opera. In a letter to his sister, Byron defines Bologna as famous for its ‘poets, cardinals, painters…… and sausages’.

Byron returned to Bologna in June 1919, after having left Venice in his white ‘Napoleonic’ coach, made in London by the famous builder Baxter. His intention was to continue on towards Ravenna, the residence of his latest sweetheart Countess Teresa Guiccioli. 

Byron’s ‘picturesque vehicle’, a kind of ante-litteram camper, equipped with a bed and supplies, was followed by a car for the servants and numerous pets. It stopped in front of the Pellegrino Hotel on via de’ Vetturini, now known as via Ugo Bassi. Byron stayed in room number 5 on the first floor, equipped with a fireplace, an antique mirror, and a window overlooking via Calcavinazzi.

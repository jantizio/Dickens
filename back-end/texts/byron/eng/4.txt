Lord Byron’s life<br/>

Byron was a British Romantic poet and satirist whose poetry and personality captured the imagination of Europe. He gained notoriety for his scandalous private life and is described by one contemporary as ‘mad, bad and dangerous to know’.

George Gordon Byron was born on January 22, 1788, in London, England. He grew up in Aberdeen, Scotland, and inherited his family's English title at the age of ten, becoming Baron Byron of Rochdale. Abandoned by his father at an early age and resentful of his mother, who he blamed for his being born with a deformed foot, Byron isolated himself during his youth and was deeply unhappy. Though he was the heir to an idyllic estate, the property was run down and his family had no assets with which to care for it. As a teenager, Byron discovered that he was attracted to men as well as women, which made him all the more remote and secretive.

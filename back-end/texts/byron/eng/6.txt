In July 1809, Byron set out on his "grand tour," which included Portugal, Spain, Albania, Greece, and Turkey. His impressions of these countries formed the substance of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Cantos I and II, published in 1812. Childe Harold became immensely popular and Byron was lionized by London high society. The success of Childe Harold encouraged Byron to write a series of tales with a Turkish or Greek background, all of which were received with popularity. 
Early in 1815, Byron married Anne Isabella Milbanke. A year later his wife left him, taking with her their daughter, Augusta Ada Byron. A separation was later arranged. Facing mounting pressure as a result of his failed marriage, scandalous affairs and huge debts, Byron left England in April 1816 and never returned. He spent the summer of 1816 at Lake Geneva with Percy Bysshe Shelley, his wife Mary and Mary's half sister Claire Clairmont, with whom Byron had a daughter.
Byron travelled on to Italy, where he was to live for more than six years. In 1819, while staying in Venice, he began an affair with Teresa Guiccioli, the wife of an Italian nobleman. It was in this period that Byron wrote some of his most famous works, including 'Don Juan' (1819-1824).
In July 1823, Byron left Italy to join the Greek insurgents who were fighting a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire. On 19 April 1824 he died from fever at Missolonghi, in modern day Greece. His death was mourned throughout Britain. His body was brought back to England and buried at his ancestral home in Nottinghamshire.

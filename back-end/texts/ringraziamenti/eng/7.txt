The cultural and educational activity was part of the School Training with an agreement with the Municipality of Bologna and took place in part at the Certosa and the Museo del Risorgimento. We thank Dr. Otello Sangiorgi, head of the Museum of the Risorgimento of Bologna-Certosa, for his availability and support for the initiative.

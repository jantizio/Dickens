In this regard, our warmest thanks are for Alessia Branchi, director and soul of the 8cento Association, who spent so much time explaining to students the clothing at Dickensâ€™ time, who kindly provided the costumes of the time and followed the students during the shooting, providing many valuable indications and suggestions for the historical re-enactment.

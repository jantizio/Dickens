A very special thanks goes to Roberto Martorelli, Head of the Museum of the Certosa and Author, among other things, of the book "Dickens in Bologna and a memorable visit to the Certosa". Roberto Martorelli followed us step by step in the development of the project, providing the students and referents with many invaluable explanations, suggestions and advice, without which this project would never have reached the degree of in-depth study to which the students have reached, despite the difficulties and limitations due to the ongoing pandemic situation.

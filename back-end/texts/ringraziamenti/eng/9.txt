Our warmest thanks go to all the institutions that have supported us and allowed us to carry out the project: <br/>
The Emilia-Romagna Region, the Municipality of Bologna, the British Embassy in Rome, which kindly granted us patronage, as well as all the institutions that collaborated offering us access to in-depth materials and granted us the use of images of the time: the Archiginnasio Library, the National Art Gallery of Bologna, the Museum of Peasant Civilization in Bentivoglio.

The elegant tie with a frappe towards the center and a decorated and colored vest, seems to be made of precious fabric, the tailcoat of a dark border. Until the mid 40s they are stopped by a sort of gaiter that passed under the heel that made the leg slimmer and ended with a small shoe, like today's dancers. In his hand he has a hat, no one went out without a hat, a cane and a cloak. The hair has a parting on one side, a mustache, a goatee and sideburns from one side to the other that frames the face.<br/>
In terms of women in the 1840â€™s, they wore their necks uncovered both in summer and in winter, as well as a bodice with a pin, typical of this period. The bodice was very tight, with a corset underneath, and some women even fainted because of how tight it was. Shoulders were enriched with frappe and the sleeves were often balloon shaped and curled up to the elbow. Gloves were puffy with crinoline. They wore very particular hairstyles: ears are covered in a wide but low chignon and then a headdress.

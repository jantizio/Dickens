In this image of a man and woman dancing, the woman wears a flower on her chest and in her hair, a dress with a kind of petticoat underneath opened by a curtain of fabric. At the neck there are folds that enrich the bodice, and white gloves for both women and men. The man wears an elegant shirt with a waistcoat with a wide collar. A tailcoat, trousers with a thin line and  shoes with little heels for dancing. Long, neat hair with a parting on one side.

In other images showing outfits for going out in, (image of the three men in a study discussing) the tailcoat has tails that reach the knees and fall in a classic way on the shoe. Trousers could be light, dark, or striped with fairly classic shoes: dark, with a little heel, with not too elongated or square toes. If you look closer at the image, the men have thick mustaches and sideburns, another important element in terms of style.

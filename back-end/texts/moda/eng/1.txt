This interesting information about fashion in Dickensâ€™s time has been given to the students by Mrs Alessia Branchi, Artistic Director and key role in the Association 8cento.<br/><br/>
It is thanks to the images that we find in the paintings and in some prototypes of photography that we can see how the fashion of 1800's clothes was for the middle class. If we focus on the way they dressed at that time, it is only right to start with their hair. It seems secondary but it is fundamental when a character is recalled and it is different from that of today, both for men and for women.

Duties of the caretaker/guide
The caretaker/guide, a role unique to Bologna, had various duties: he performed the role of looking after the monuments, archivist and guide, and he was required to wear a formal uniform. For his duties, the caretaker/guide was provided with accommodation in the courtyard entrance of the Certosa, but did not receive a salary. His profits came from the generosity of the visitors.

The role of the Sibaud family ends in 1916, when the Municipality decides that the cemetery is always open and accessible every day. The last of the Sibaud family caretaker/guides, Germano junior, appealed for the loss of proceeds in 1903, which happened because visitors were allowed to enter the cemetery without being accompanied by a caretaker/guide. In 1916, the city council of Bologna relieved him from all his duties including that of a guide, with the obligation to leave the accommodation in the Certosa that his family had occupied for almost a century, within a year. Germano was not entitled to any pension but obtained an allowance of 1779.30 L.

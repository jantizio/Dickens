Some of the visitors of the Certosa with whom the caretaker/guides came into contact with were famous personalities such as Lord Byron, Jules Janin and Charles Dickens.

On the occasion of his visit to Bologna in November 1844, Dickens met Marcellino Sibaud in his elegant uniform:
“There was such a very smart official in attendance at the Cemetery where the little Cicerone had buried his children…”<sup><a href='#1'>1</a></sup>.
Marcellino accompanied Dickens in the second part of his visit to the Certosa, after meeting the “little Cicerone”, of whom he leaves us an unforgettable description in Pictures from Italy.

Marcellino was an intellectual, interested in history and archaeology, one of the prominent men of the Bolognese culture of the period. He began to write a piece of work dedicated to the Certosa: a descriptive archaeological-historical work, which, however, was never actually published due to economic problems. In 1837, he published the preface at his own expense (the whole piece should have consisted of 8 volumes).

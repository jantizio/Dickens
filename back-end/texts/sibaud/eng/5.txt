The role of ‘guide’ is described in detail by Gian Marco Vidor in his interesting volume Biografia di un cimitero italiano: la Certosa di Bologna:
His duties included being a guide for visitors. With the exception of Sundays and the three openings, the rules prohibited anyone from going around the Certosa without being accompanied by the caretaker/guide or whoever took his place, generally his children. The times for the tours were 9 to 4 in the afternoon during the winter season and from 8 to 2 and then 4 to 6 in the afternoon during the summer season. In a letter dated November 16th 1838, Germano Sibaud complains about the fact that strangers come at any time, even during the evening without respecting the schedules.

Referring to the caretaker/guide Marcellino Sibaud, while not sparing him some criticism, Dickens writes in Pictures from Italy:
“It seemed to be his duty to describe the monuments to the people - at all events he was doing so [...] He was neither shabby, nor insolent, nor churlish, nor ignorant. He spoke his own language with perfect propriety, and seemed to consider himself, in his way, a kind of teacher of the people, and to entertain a just respect both for himself and them.”<sup><a href='#2'>2</a></sup>

When describing the Certosa, a representative place of the history and art of the city, he must carefully avoid anything that painted it in a bad light. For acting as a guide, he will not be allowed to claim any compensation from visitors, but he will still be able to accept what they spontaneously offer.
In the aforementioned letter, Germano Sibaud very proudly tells of how after his tour of the cemetery, foreigners leave it astonished and amazed, confessing that they have never imagined such a surprising thing, and praising this establishment as the first of its kind in Europe. But he also does not avoid underlining how many visitors complain about the fact that many noble Bolognese families have monuments only in painting and how, in the monumental areas of the cemetery, between important tombs, there are empty arches or those occupied by half a tombstone. Among the foreigners who visit are Princes, Bishops, representatives of the European aristocracy, artists and writers.

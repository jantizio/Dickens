Marcellino was also the owner of “Il Piccol Reno”, an eight-page weekly newspaper that first started in Bologna on October 17th 1844. It was printed at the San Tommaso D’Aquino printing house and was managed by Via delle Grade di San Domenico n.492.  The newspaper dealt with topics such as local and non-local historical events, poems, philosophical reflections, reviews of books and shows. Of course, a lot of attention was given to issues relating to the Certosa of Bologna, which appears for the first time in issue number 20 and will reappear in the following papers. Marcellino describes it to us as it was at the time when Dickens visited it. In issue number 41, Marcellino describes the decision to close the newspaper due to the scarcity of readers.
From his wife Maria Castelli, he had two children, Giulia and Ognisante. Marcellino died on December 30th 1891. His body is currently in the Colombario Room at position n. 689-690.

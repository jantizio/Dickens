Marcellino Junior was born in 1812 in Bologna, to Chiara Pasi and Germano Sibaud, ancestor of a dynasty that will play a leading role and be witness to almost a century of life in the monumental Certosa cemetery. The father, Germano, had won the competition held by the municipality of Bologna in 1828 for the role of caretaker/guide of the Certosa, in which it was necessary to speak French and have an awareness of the culture of the period. The Sibaud family was of French origin, and moved to Bologna from Briançon, in the French Alps. They most likely moved between the end of the 18th century and the early 19th century.  
Germano and Marcellino will become the caretaker/guides of the Bolognese Cemetery, carrying out their work with great success. Marcellino initially carried out the function of “magazziniere verificatore” at the cemetery. Then during the last two years of his father’s life, he also carried out the function of caretaker/guide for progressively longer periods, although always in an informal way. After Germano’s death, Marcellino continued this work, which was only made official in 1843, when he obtained a certificate in compliance with the cemetery custodians office. Fortunately, Marcellino documented his time there through regular correspondence with the Municipality. His letters are now preserved in the Historical Archive of the Municipality of Bologna and describe the problems he encountered while fulfilling his role as caretaker/guide and narrate everyday facts, sometimes unimportant, but very useful for a historical reconstruction of life inside the Certosa.

The National Picture Gallery of Bologna
"The museum was founded in 1808 as a picture gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts, the educational institution that arose from the ashes of the eighteenth-century Clementine Academy. The ancient building, coming from the Institute of Sciences, is enriched by the extraordinary collection of almost a thousand paintings resulting from the suppression of churches and convents after the Napoleonic troops entered Bologna between 1797 and 1810. 
The Art Gallery acquired many rooms and works throughout the nineteenth century: the result of the suppressions of 1866 implemented by the new Italian state, but also of bequests and acquisitions.

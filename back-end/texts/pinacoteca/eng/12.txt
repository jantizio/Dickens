In 1598, already an independent painter, he painted the Coronation of the Virgin and four saints, today in the Art Gallery of Bologna, for the church of San Bernardo, and won the competition, in competition with Ludovico Carracci, for the execution of the fresco made to celebrate, in 1598, the solemn entry into Bologna of Pope Clement VIII Aldobrandini. This fresco represented the break with his old master and with other students of the Carracci and decreed in a decisive way the beginning of a successful career that led him in 1601 in Rome where he lived, although with frequent interruptions, until 1614.
Welcomed into the Roman papal circle, he obtained important commissions. In 1608 Pope Paul V entrusted him with the decoration of two rooms in the Vatican Palaces, the Aldobrandine Wedding Hall and the Hall of the Dames.
After a brief stay in Naples, still in Rome in early 1614, he returned permanently to Bologna in October 1614. The Massacre of the Innocents and the Victorious Samson, works that Dickens certainly had the opportunity to admire at the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Bologna, were probably started in Rome and finished in Bologna (twenty shields were in fact anticipated in Rome for the commission of the massacre).

Domenico Zampieri known as Domenichino was the protagonist of Bolognese painting, he was one of the promoters of seventeenth-century European classicism. A pupil first of D. Calvaert then of the Carraccis, he was a cultured artist, elaborating in a refined eclecticism the formal experiences of the great masters of the sixteenth century. He worked in Rome for the decoration of Palazzo Farnese and, after an intense independent activity, in Naples, where he greatly influenced local production. He composed his figures with exemplary simplicity and clarity, modulating the tones in precious chromatic ranges.
In 1602 he was in Rome, collaborating with Annibale Carracci for the frescoes of the Farnese palace.
Particularly noteworthy among his frescoes are the decorations of the vault of the Giustiniani palace in Bassano di Sutri (1609), of the Farnese chapel in the abbey of Grottaferrata (1610), of the chapel of S. Cecilia in S. Luigi dei Francesi ( 1611-1614), of a room of the Aldobrandini villa in Frascati (1616-17), of the pendentives of the dome and of the tribune of S. Andrea della Valle (1623-28) and of those of S. Carlo ai Catinari (1630) in Rome; of the chapel of the Treasury in the cathedral in Naples (from 1638).

Another principle of Carracci's doctrine was the devotional aspect, respect for the orthodoxy of the stories represented. In doing this, the Carraccis followed the instructions contained in the work of the theorists of the time such as Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, author in 1582 of the Discourse on sacred and profane images, who called for the control by the ecclesiastical authorities of the contents of the sacred scenes. 
These are in summary the three major paths along which seventeenth-century European art unfolds: classicism, naturalism and the baroque.

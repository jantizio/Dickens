It’s difficult to define the work of Ludovico Carracci from about 1595 until 1602, given the experimental character of his style in this period. In general, he further developed the Baroque premises of his style in paintings crammed with large, violently gesticulating figures, and enhanced by strong chiaroscuro effects. An example is the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ (1595-96: Bologna, National Art Gallery).
Ludovico was "a great interpreter of both the high spirituality of the Counter-Reformation and the simplicity of everyday life.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
Some of his masterpieces are preserved in the National Art Gallery of Bologna.

Then, you can follow the cornerstones of the Emilian seventeenth century with works by Guido Reni, among whose masterpieces the 'Massacre of the innocents' and the so-called 'Altarpiece of the vote' should be mentioned; with the three extraordinary altarpieces by Domenichino depicting 'The martyrdom of Saint Agnes', the 'Madonna del Rosario' and the 'Saint Peter martyr'; the 'Baptism of Christ' by Francesco Albani; the 'Lamentation over Christ' by Alessandro Tiarini, 'Sebastian curated by Irene' and 'Vestition of Saint William', by Guercino.
The itinerary ends with the multiform eighteenth century - aristocratic and popular vaults - by Giuseppe Maria Crespi (namely the 'Farm' and 'Self-portrait'); by Donato Creti (the two 'Allegorical Tombs') and the brothers Gaetano and Ubaldo Gandolfi.2

Ludovico was born in Bologna in 1555; a cousin of Agostino and Annibale Carracci, founders in around 1585, Ludovico and his cousins had founded the so-called Eclectic Academy of painting (also called the Accademia degli Incamminati). A school / workshop intended as a place where the new artistic ideas of the three cousins, matured by combining the real-life study of the masters of the sixteenth century (Correggio, Tiziano and Veronese), could be practiced and taught to young students. The intent was to reform painting by returning to the ‘natural’.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
Ludovico took a leading part in establishing the Carracci workshop and style. He worked almost all his life in Bologna where he died.
Ludovico tutored a number of Emilian artists and helped encourage the so-called Bolognese School of the late 16th century, which included Albani, Guercino, Sacchi, Reni, Lanfranco and Domenichino.

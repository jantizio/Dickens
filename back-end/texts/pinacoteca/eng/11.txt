The large hall 24 of the National Art Gallery of Bologna now houses the most important works made in Bologna by Guido Reni, the greatest exponent of the classical ideal of the seventeenth century, in a path that touches all phases of the artistic path of Reni.
He was born in Bologna, in today’s Palazzo Ariosti in 3, San Felice street, to Daniele, a musician and Master of the Chapel of San Petronio, and Ginevra Pozzi. He was entrusted, as a child, to the teachings of the Flemish painter Denys Calvaert, of which he was a disciple for ten years and soon reached an important role within the workshop.
In 1594 Guido left Calvaert to join the Incamminati Academy, a school of painting founded by the Carracci’s in 1585 with the name of the Eager's Academy (the name was changed in 1590). Here he studied oil painting and the burin engraving. His extraordinary talent made him at first an appreciated assistant to Ludovico Carracci, and later his rival. Malvasia tells the anecdote of the suggestion given by Hannibal to Ludovico Carracci, not to teach him so much, that one day he will know more than all of us. Do you not see that he is never content, he seeks new things? Join together, Lodovico, that he one day wishes to make you sigh.

Among the large canvases, the Communion of St. Gerolamo (1614, Vatican Pinacoteca); the Guardian Angel (1615, Naples, Capodimonte Museum); the Hunt of Diana and the Cumaean Sibyl (about 1617, Rome, Galleria Borghese).
As a cultured artist, he aimed not so much at resurrecting but at evoking sixteenth-century classicism and understanding its deep meaning. Thanks to these skills, he succeeded in merging figures and landscape in a sincere naturalism, which in his works plays a very notable part, especially in the paintings (Labors of Hercules; Erminia among the shepherds, Paris, Louvre) and in the frescoes of mythological subjects. Often even in the less demanding pictures he reached precursor results of modern taste, composing the landscape with a broad classical sense and open sensitivity to the problems of light and color.
The National Art Gallery of Bologna preserves some of his masterpieces. Below are some that Dickens will have admired during his visit to the Pinacoteca of Bologna.

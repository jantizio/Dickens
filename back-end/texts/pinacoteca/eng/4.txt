You can start your visit from the rich testimonies of the Bolognese Fourteenth century, with works by Pseudo Jacopino, Vitale and Simone dei Crocefissi, without forgetting the significant presence of the polyptych by Giotto. For this first period of the history of Bolognese paintings, the section dedicated to the frescoes from the small church of S. Maria di Mezzaratta, recomposed according to the original architectural structure, is of particular importance. 
The Renaissance period is made up of pieces by Francesco del Cossa from Ferrara with the 'Pala dei Mercanti' and Ercole Roberti with the small fragment of the Garganelli chapel in S. Pietro and by Francesco Francia from Bologna, with numerous altarpieces. 
Proceeding from the masterpiece 'Ecstasy of Santa Cecilia' painted for Bologna by Raphael, the route reaches - after the works of Parmigianino (the so-called 'Pala di S. Margherita') and Passerotti - to the reform of the late sixteenth century, with works by the Carraccis, in which the 'Communion of St. Jerome' by Agostino, the 'Altarpiece of St. Ludovico' by Annibale, the 'Annunciation' and the 'Madonna Bargellini' by Ludovico must be mentioned.

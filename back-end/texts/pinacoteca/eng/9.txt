Ludovico studied with Prospero Fontana, and probably with Camillo Procaccini, between 1570 and 1580; in 1578 he was accepted into the company of painters in Bologna, and it is likely that around 1575 he left his city for some time to travel and study.
The first work dated by Ludovico Carracci is the Madonna Bargellini in 1588 (Bologna, National Art Gallery).
At the beginning of the last decade of the century, Carracci had a rapid evolution towards a proto-Baroque style.
When Annibale and Agostino left Bologna (1594-95), Ludovico continued to run the workshop and the Accademia degli Incamminati. Ludovico always lived in Bologna, except for a brief visit to Rome in 1602. After the departure of his cousins, he no longer had important rivals among the painters of the city, so his work significantly influenced the painting of the early 17th century in Bologna and, more generally, in Emilia Romagna.
However, around 1610 his direct influence in Bologna began to diminish. His workshop began to be less frequented as younger artists such as Guido Reni established themselves in the city. Nevertheless, Ludovicoâ€™s work continued to be much in demand until his death in Bologna on 13 Nov. 1619: he was buried in the now destroyed church of St. Mary Magdalene of Galliera.

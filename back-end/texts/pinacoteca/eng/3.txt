The biggest transformation of the space took place between 1914 and 1920, with the addition of a corridor leading to the large octagonal room (work of the architect Edoardo Collamarini, under the direction of Francesco Malaguzzi Valeri), and in the second post-war period with the construction of the Salone del Renaissance. 
The last adaptation (completed in 1974) was completed thanks to the architect Leone Pancaldi, under the guidance of the then director Cesare Gnudi: it was on this occasion that the current staircase was created in the space of the ancient chapel known as the Novitiate, frescoed with the “Glory of Saint Ignatius” by the Jesuit painter Giuseppe Barbieri.

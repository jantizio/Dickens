<b><u>Painting between the late 1500s and early 1600s</u></b>
After the Council of Trent the spirit of the Renaissance was decidedly exhausted, but not the painting, defined as "Mannerist", which was derived from it. The overcoming of this painting took place in a couple of decades between the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, thanks above all to three painters: Annibale Carracci, Michelangelo Merisi known as Caravaggio and the Flemish painter Pieter Paul Rubens. Annibale Carracci is the youngest of a trio of Bolognese artists formed by him, his brother Agostino and his cousin Ludovico. These three artists gave life to the Accademia degli Incamminati in Bologna, which was the centre of gravity of that seventeenth-century art trend that we call "classicism". In their teachings they tried to combine the model of the great sixteenth-century masters, such as Raphael and Titian, with a renewed study of the truth: in practice a painting that combines idealism (made of harmony, proportion, decoration, measure, etc.) with realism (made above all of inspiration and study of reality). The eldest, Ludovico Carracci, assumed the role of theorist and imposed the direction towards the study of truth (first drawn and then cleaned of defects), the direct approach to the subject depicted was the first step of the representation in order to make it more natural. Augustine, a man of great culture, in his school became the teacher of anatomy and perspective, as a profound connoisseur of mythology he could influence his brother Hannibal. Hannibal was the most gifted and the one who, following his trip to Rome in 1595 and the works carried out until his death in 1609, exercised a decisive influence on the fate of Italian painting at the dawn of the seventeenth century, probably holding the role of teacher of painting technique.

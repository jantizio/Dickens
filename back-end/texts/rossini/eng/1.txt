Gioacchino Rossini was born on February 29th 1792, in Pesaro, to Anna Guidarini and Giuseppe Rossini. Her family was of simple origins and a strong supporter of the French. As a boy, Rossini learned the fundamental teachings of music theory in a school in Lugo, a small town in the province of Ravenna. 
By the age of twenty, three of his works had already been represented.
The official debut is dated in 1810 in Venice. From then on, he became more and more famous until he was considered one of the greatest and most famous opera performers in history. His work has ranged accross various musical genres, but he is remembered mainly for famous works such as Il Barbiere di Siviglia, L'Italiana in Algiers or La Cenerentola. 
Rossini was not just buried at the Certosa. He was buried twice. He travelled to Paris, leaving his first wife, the great Spanish opera singer Isabella Colbran, in Bologna with his parents. He died in Passy, near Paris, in 1868 and was buried in the PÃ¨re Lachaise cemetery. 
In 1887 his remains were transferred to Florence, in the Basilica of Santa Croce, as requested by the Italian government, where the most famous people in Italian culture lie, and in 1900 the funeral monument, made by Giuseppe Cassioli, would be inaugurated. The caretaker of the Certosa, Marcellino Sibaud told Jules Janin that he would steal Rossini's bones from Paris and take them to the Certosa, in order to make the Italian cemetery famous.

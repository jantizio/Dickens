The Pellegrino hotel stopped taking guests in around 1930, the entire building was later heavily damaged by bombing in 1943 during the last world war.
At number 7, via Ugo Bassi, on the corner of via Calcavinazzi, there is a plaque commemorating the building. The plaque, placed on the facade of the current building by the Municipality of Bologna in 2008, recalls the presence of the Albergo del Pellegrino from 1500 to 1930. The original work, starting from 1886, is kept inside the door. The text on the inscription, the work of the poet and writer Giosu√® Carducci, recalls that the great English poet Lord Byron stayed here and also mentions the other illustrious guests Casanova and Dickens.

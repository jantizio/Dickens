Dickens arrived in Bologna, coming from Modena, around midnight on November 9 1844 after a long and tiring night journey in a carriage along Via Emilia,constantly afraid of being robbed, considering - as Dickens points out - also the low efficiency in matters of public order and the bad governance of the <a href="/pontificio">Papal State</a>  . 
"I had entered Bologna by night - almost midnight - and all along the road thither, after our entrance into the Papal territory: which is not, in any part, supremely well governed, Saint Peter's keys being rather rusty now; the driver had so worried about the danger of robbers in traveling after dark, and had so infected the brave Courier, and the two had been so constantly stopping and getting up and down to look after a portmanteau which was tied on behind, that I should have felt obliged to anyone who would have had the goodness to take it away.‚Äù<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
The carriage entered Bologna from Porta San Felice and continued towards the city center until it reached the Pellegrino hotel.

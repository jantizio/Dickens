Later it was bought by Giovanni Tricchi, a Milanese haberdasher, ‘a great gentleman and very courteous person’. In 1887 the lower part of the façade was entirely covered with marble by the new owner Francesco Ravaldoni.”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
This is how it is described in the Guida illustrata di Bologna - Storica artistica industriale (Illustrated Guide of Bologna - Industrial Art History), published in 1892 by the Successori Monti Typography: "The Albergo del Pellegrino is noteworthy for the speciality that presents its façade, which in the lower half is all of marble. Inside this hotel has all the modern comforts possible, both from the side of the most scrupulous cleanliness and from that of the most absolute property. In the vestibule, a plaque reminds us that Lord Byron was lodged in this house as well as most of the sovereigns of Europe.”<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
And, again, confirming the fame enjoyed by the hotel, "Giancarlo Roversi remembers in one of his writings that the hotel was defined by a guide of 1914 as:" special for its all-marble facade in the lower half and first-rate with all possible modern comforts, both in terms of heating and lighting, as well as impeccable and perfect service.”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>

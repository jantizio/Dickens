"In 1803 Giacomo Gatti in his Descrizione delle più rare cose di Bologna, e suoi sobborghi (Description of the rarest things in Bologna, and its suburbs), cites between the hotels 'the Pellegrino and the San Marco, where famous characters stay, and bear the title of Imperial and Royal Hotels'. Its fame as a first-rate hotel is then confirmed in the Bolognese guides of Michelangelo Gualandi and Salvatore Muzzi of the mid-nineteenth century, and also by being chosen by many English tourists who mention it in their travel diaries.”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
The Pellegrino hotel was also renowned for its kitchen: "In the book Gioco di tutte le osterie (game of all taverns) by Mitelli, the hotel is remembered for its good cakes. In the eighteenth century the Marquis Albergati praised the eels and cotechini that were eaten in this hotel. But the tortellini, chickens and pigeons were also excellent, which perhaps also delighted Goethe.

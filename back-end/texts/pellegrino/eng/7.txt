“… The chief among the waiters who visited this lonely retreat, where there was no other company but the swallows in the broad eaves over the windows, was a man who had only one idea about the English; and the subject of this harmless monomania was Lord Byron. I made the discovery by accidentally remarking to him, at breakfast, that the matting with which the floor was covered, was very comfortable at that season, when he replied immediately that milord Beeron had very much attached to that kind of matting. Observing, at the same moment, that I took no milk, he exclaimed with enthusiasm that milor Beeron had never touched it. At first, I took it for granted,in my innocence, that he had been one of the Beeron servants; but no, he said, no, he was in the habit of speaking about my Lord, to English gentlemen; that was all. He knew all about him, he said. In proof of it, he connected him with every possible topic, from the Monte Pulciano wine dinner (which was grown on an estate he had owned) to the big bed itself, with his final bow in the yard, a parting assurance that the road by which I was going, had been Milor Beeron’s favourite ride; and he ran briskly upstairs again, I dare say to tell some other Englishman in some other solitary room that the guest who had just departed was Lord Beeron’s living image.”7

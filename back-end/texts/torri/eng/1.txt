Before leaving Bologna, Dickens visited the city and recorded some short and incisive impressions, which he left in the book Pictures from Italy. Dickens was a curious and critical traveler who described Bologna in a journalistic way with the eyes of a foreigner fascinated by the beauty of Italy, but also with repudiation of the stagnant situation present in the city.

“Again, an ancient sombre town, under the brilliant sky; with heavy arcades over the footways of the older streets, and lighter and more cheerful archways in the newer portions of the town.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

A shady sequence of arcades winds its way along the irregular path of its roads arranged as a ray around the two towers. The writer as a whole is fascinated by the picturesque aspects of the urban landscape, originating from the contrast between the noble past and the abandonment and squalor of the present. He is baffled by unusual contexts for him, where monumentality and decadence come together: The shady sequence of porticoed paths that follows the irregular route of the streets reinforces the picturesque appearance of Bologna, because, even without possessing real ruins, the city is both ancient and decadent, and its population offers travellers shows of misery and widespread poverty. Dickens guides his reader to the knowledge of the urban environment as through a Wunderkammer, with a theatrical and almost fantastic vision as in the projections of a magic lantern. Dickens doesn't like arcades, like other English travellers of his time: Stendhal, Shelley, Lady Morgan.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>

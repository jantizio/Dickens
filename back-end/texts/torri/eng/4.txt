The two towers are commonly recognized as a symbol of Bologna and rise in the heart of the city. Both built during the Middle Ages, they had a military function (signaling and defense) and represented with their grandeur the social prestige of the family responsible for the construction.
The Torre degli Asinelli was built between 1109 and 1119 by the family of the same name and passed to the municipality already in the following century. Climbing the 498 steps of its internal staircase, you reach the summit from which you can enjoy a spectacular view of the city from the height of its 97.20 meters. The fortress surrounding the base was built in 1488 to house the soldiers on guard; then occupied by workshops for hammering.
The Garisenda Tower, built in the same period, is distinguished by its lower height of only 48 meters. It is known for its steep slope, due to the subsidence of the ground and foundations, so much so that Dante Alighieri, passing through Bologna several times in his life, included it in the XXXI Canto of Hell. It was originally 60 meters high and was lowered for fear of future collapse in the mid-14th century. The selenite base dates back to the restoration in 1889.

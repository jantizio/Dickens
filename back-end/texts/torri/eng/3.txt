“There is a grave and learned air about the city, and a pleasant gloom upon it, that would leave it, a distinct and separate impression in the mind, among a crowd of cities”<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>
With the Papal Restoration, the city went through a period of economic crisis and the University was also heading towards a period of decline. However, the writer manages to capture a "serious and learned" atmosphere, in homage to the tradition of Bologna as an ancient seat of studies, and which is enough to leave him with a distinct memory of the city.
The arcades of Bologna will certainly have contributed to the aforementioned "pleasant gloom", which, now candidates for UNESCO "World Heritage", create plays of light and shadow, profound architectural perspectives and make Bologna unique in the world.
The two towers, symbol of the medieval city, seem "clumsy" to Dickens but, on the whole, they form the backdrop to the perspective of some narrow streets and offer a breathtaking landscape when viewed through the narrow streets of the city:

“the two brick leaning towers (sufficiently unsightly in themselves, it must be acknowledged), inclining cross-wise as if they were bowing stiffy to each other - a most extraordinary termination to the perspective of some of the narrow streets.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
